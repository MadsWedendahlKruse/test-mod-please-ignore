NOTES
Is the Wrenchable interface necessary?
Right now there's some problem with the "sides", so when breaking the multiblock with the
wrench the particles don't get spawned because we only run onWrenched on the server side

TODO LIST
- Figure out what multiblocks the mod should have
    - Furnace
    - Crusher
    - Alloy Smelter
    - Blast Furnace (for steel?)
    - Coke Oven (for steel?)
    - Assembler (for gizmos)
- Figure out what machines the mod should have. We'll probably need some to make the stuff
for making the multiblocks, or making that can just be done by hand, and we can go all in on
the multiblocks?
- Make some cool models for the multiblocks
    - Turn the models into blueprints. Maybe I can make them like Immersive Engineering
    where there's dedicated blocks for e.g. power input and item input/output? Not sure
    if that's cool or would end up being a bit annoying? If I don't do it like this, I'll
    have to make each block a full block, otherwise it's gonna look weird when you connect
    e.g. a power cable to the side of the block and it's just floating in the air.
- Figure out some kind of way to display the blueprints
    - Would be cool to do it in the world as some kind of hologram. This could maybe be 
    some kind of item that allows you to select a blueprint and then you can place it in
    the world and it'll show the actual blocks in the blueprint and where they should go.
- Maybe it would be cool if you can build it semi-automatically?
    - Right click the hologram and it'll fill in the blocks for you if you have them in
    your inventory?
- Make the multiblocks do stuff (implement the actual code)
- Make a cool GUI for the multiblocks
- Sounds for the multiblocks
- JEI support for the multiblocks
    - Would be cool if we could have a JEI recipe for the multiblock itself, where you can
    see the model of the multiblock and then when you click on it you can see the blueprint
    for it
    - This way I can maybe avoid having to make some kind of book or something for the mod.
    Might make a book anyway...
